            <p> The <strong>Moon</strong> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a>'s only natural satellite. It is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_satellites">fifth largest satellite</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System">Solar System</a> and the largest and most massive relative to its parent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet">planet</a>,<sup>[f]</sup> with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent)">Australia</a>).<sup>[16]</sup> The Moon is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary-mass_object">planetary-mass object</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_differentiation">differentiated</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet">rocky body</a>, making it a satellite planet under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_definition_of_planet">geophysical definitions of the term</a> and larger than all known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet">dwarf planets</a> of the Solar System.<sup>[17]</sup> It lacks any significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_the_Moon">atmosphere</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere" >hydrosphere</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field_of_the_Moon">magnetic field</a>. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_gravity">surface gravity</a> is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force">g</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)">Io</a> being the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.  </p>

            <p>The Moon orbits Earth at an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance_(astronomy)">average distance</a> of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter. Its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide">tides</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration"></a>very slowly lengthens</a> Earth's day. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon%27s_orbit">Moon's orbit</a> around Earth has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_period">sidereal period</a> of 27.3 days. During each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_period">synodic period</a> of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon">the near side</a>) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_day">lunar day</a> is the same as the synodic period. However, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through cyclical shifts in perspective known as <a hred="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration">libration</a>.</p>
    
            <p>The most widely accepted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_Moon">origin explanation</a> posits that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth">not long after Earth</a>, out of the debris from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis">giant impact</a> between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet)">Theia</a>. It then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago. The lunar surface is fairly non-reflective, with the reflectance of lunar soil being comparable to that of asphalt. However, due to its large angular diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse.</p>

            <p>Both the Moon's prominence in Earth's sky and its regular cycle of phases have provided cultural references and influences for human societies throughout history. Such influences can be found in language, calendar systems, art, and mythology. The first artificial object to reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's uncrewed Luna 2 spacecraft in 1959; this was followed by the first successful soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966. The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the United States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface between 1969 and 1972. These and later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins, internal structure, and subsequent history. The Moon is the only celestial body visited by humans.</p>

            <h2>Names and Etymology</h2><hr>
            <p class="special">See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon#Mythology_and_art:">Moon § Mythology and art</a></p>

             <p>The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply Moon, with a capital M.[18][19] The noun moon is derived from Old English mōna, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic *mēnōn,[20] which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *mēnsis "month"[21] (from earlier *mēnōt, genitive *mēneses) which may be related to the verb "measure" (of time).[22]</p>
    
            <p>Occasionally, the name Luna /ˈluːnə/ is used in scientific writing[23] and especially in science fiction to distinguish the Earth's moon from others, while in poetry "Luna" has been used to denote personification of the Moon.[24] Cynthia /ˈsɪnθiə/ is another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon personified as a goddess,[25] while Selene /səˈliːniː/ (literally "Moon") is the Greek goddess of the Moon.   </p>

             <p>The usual English adjective pertaining to the Moon is "lunar", derived from the Latin word for the Moon, lūna. The adjective selenian /səliːniən/,[26] derived from the Greek word for the Moon, σελήνη selēnē, and used to describe the Moon as a world rather than as an object in the sky, is rare,[27] while its cognate selenic was originally a rare synonym[28] but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium.[29] The Greek word for the Moon does however provide us with the prefix seleno-, as in selenography, the study of the physical features of the Moon, as well as the element name selenium.[30][31]</p>

             <p>The Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, Artemis, equated with the Roman Diana, one of whose symbols was the Moon and who was often regarded as the goddess of the Moon, was also called Cynthia, from her legendary birthplace on Mount Cynthus.[32] These names – Luna, Cynthia and Selene – are reflected in technical terms for lunar orbits such as apolune, pericynthion and selenocentric.</p>

             <p>The astronomical symbol for the Moon is a crescent, ☾, for example in M☾ 'lunar mass' (also ML).</p>

            <h2>Formation</h2><hr>
            <p>Main articles: Origin of the Moon, Giant-impact hypothesis, and Circumplanetary disk Isotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System.[33][34] Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed,[35] but none satisfactorily explains the features of the Earth–Moon system. A fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force[36] would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth.[37] Gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon[38] depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon.[37] A co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon.[37] None of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.[39]</p>
            <p>The prevailing theory is that the Earth–Moon system formed after a giant impact of a Mars-sized body (named Theia) with the proto-Earth. The impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and the material accreted and formed the Moon[40][41] just beyond the Earth's Roche limit of ~2.56 R🜨.[42]</p>
            <p>Giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth.[43] However, more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the proto-Earth.[44][45][46][47] Other bodies of the inner Solar System such as Mars and Vesta have, according to meteorites from them, very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to Earth. However, Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two,[48] although this is debated.[49]</p>
            <p>The impact would have released enough energy to liquefy both the ejecta and the Earth's crust, forming a magma ocean. The liquefied ejecta could have then re-accreted into the Earth–Moon system.[50][51] Similarly, the newly formed Moon would have had its own lunar magma ocean; its depth is estimated from about 500 km (300 miles) to 1,737 km (1,079 miles).[50]</p>
            <p>While the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence, some questions are still unresolved, most of which involve the Moon's composition.[52][example needed]Above a high resolution threshold for simulations, a study published in 2022 finds that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside Earth's Roche limit. Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider, stable orbits.[53]</p>

            <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2><hr>
            <p>The Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to adjust to its orbit.[58]</p>

            <h2>Modern culture representation</h2>
            <p>See also: Moon in science fiction and List of appearances of the Moon in fiction</p>

            <p>The perception of the Moon in modern times has been informed by telescope enabled modern astronomy and later by spaceflight enabled actual human activity at the Moon, particularly the culturally impactful lunar landings. These new insights inspired cultural references, connecting romantic reflections about the Moon[301] and speculative fiction such as science-fiction dealing with the Moon.[302][303]</p>

            <p>Contemporarily the Moon has been seen as a place for economic expansion into space, with missions prospecting for lunar resources. This has been accompanied with renewed public and critical reflection on humanity's cultural and legal relation to the celestial body, especially regarding colonialism,[248] as in the 1970 poem "Whitey on the Moon". In this light the Moon's nature has been invoked,[274] particularly for lunar conservation[250] and as a common.[304][268][276]</p>

            <h2>Lunar effect</h2>
            <p>Main article: Lunar effect</p>
            <p>The lunar effect is a purported unproven correlation between specific stages of the roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle and behavior and physiological changes in living beings on Earth, including humans. The Moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must be affected by the Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person.[305] Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.[305][306][307][308][309]</p>
